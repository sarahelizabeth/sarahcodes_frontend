        Hi! Iâ€™m Sarah, and I invite you to poke around my super awesome website. Explore my portfolio, read about my
        daring exploits, learn about the causes & organizations that are important to me, check out my favorite books &
        movies, or ask me a question! Or you can just look at pictures of my kitty, which, honestly, is probably the
        best use of your time.
